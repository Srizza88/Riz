Revising the requestI’m redesigning the exception request for clarity, ensuring the specified sections remain intact. I’ll streamline the control sections and highlight enhancements.Refining the structureI’m organizing content into a minimal bullet list, focusing on clarity. Adding suggestions like IP restrictions or access control lists will enrich the request's effectiveness.Streamlining specificsI’m refining the exception request by clarifying host-based intrusion detection and ensuring the heading structure remains intact. Emphasizing the constraint of fewer than 100 users is crucial.Clarifying application specificsI’m mapping out the AIT 69990 - MCOE Teamsite's features, emphasizing public, non-critical data, and streamlined content creation. Highlighting the approach to vendor issues enhances understanding.Clarifying control measuresI’m detailing mitigating controls, ensuring precise network traffic filtering specifications, and addressing closure delays until Q1 2025. Each control is evaluated for effectiveness.Refining security measuresI’m detailing specific steps to enhance security: ensuring network traffic is filtered to block known attackers, accessing resources via IP or multi-factor authentication, and configuring WAFs to detect web threats.Establishing real-time monitoringI’m setting up real-time alerts for suspicious activity on SPLUNK to detect potential attacks. Adequate controls are recommended, with further enhancements needed for a comprehensive risk profile.Application Details:AIT 69990 - MCOE Teamsite
This application uses an Open Text product to create marketing website content and relies on the OpenDeploy tool for content publishing. The data involved is non-critical, public, externally developed/hosted, and internally facing. Fewer than 100 internal or vendor users have access.Executive Summary:MCOE Teamsite is developed by Open Text Inc. for marketing content creation and uses OpenDeploy for content publishing. There are five internal P3 ADSF findings against the application, involving Open URL Redirect, Reflected XSS, Server-Side Template Injection, and Server-Side Request Forgery.Due to extensive regression testing requirements, the vendor (Open Text Inc.) cannot provide fixes for four of these issues until late Q4 2024. Consequently, closure of these P3 findings will not occur until Q1 2025.Current Mitigating Controls:Filter Network TrafficLimit Access to Resources Over the Network (fewer than 100 internal/vendor users)Restrict Web-Based Content (WAF at CDN)Bank Proxy for Internal UsersCrowdStrike for Internal UsersTrellix (McAfee Antivirus) for Internal UsersTrendMicro Services on vendor side (BM5 VMs that monitor, detect, and respond to threats on host servers)Current Compensating Controls:Enhanced Logging and Alert Monitoring (SPLUNK)Suggested Improvements to Existing Controls:Ensure network traffic filtering includes IP reputation checks, geoblocking (if applicable), and rate-limiting.Consider strict role-based or IP-based access controls for the limited user base.Configure the WAF to specifically detect and block known URL redirect, XSS, and SSRF patterns.Confirm that endpoint detection (CrowdStrike/Trellix) is centrally monitored and updated.Verify that TrendMicro services on vendor-managed VMs meet corporate security standards and are consistently patched.Enable real-time alerts in SPLUNK for suspicious activities or repeated attack patterns, ensuring logs are retained for forensic purposes.Risk Summary and Mitigating/Compensating Controls:The five P3 findings require code fixes from Open Text Inc. Because the user base is small (fewer than 100 internal/vendor users), overall risk is considered minimal. However, the findings cannot be closed until the vendor delivers patches in Q4 2024.
